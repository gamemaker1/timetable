timetable
=========

this app allows you to import, export, and print your friend group's joint
timetable. it is a simple static site that uses a json file as its data source.

run the following commands to run the site locally at [http://localhost:8000]. 

    git clone https://github.com/gamemaker1/timetable.git
    cd timetable/
    python -m http.server

the list of courses you can select, their timings and other such details, are
all stored in [courses.json].

once you have stored your timetable, you can import/export the data as a json
file so others can view it. you may also export it as a pdf.
